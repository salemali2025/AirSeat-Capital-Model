### ‚úàÔ∏è Summary of the Concept

**AirSeat Capital** is an innovative aviation business model based on fractional ownership of aircraft **through seat investment**. Each investor buys a specific seat on a plane, effectively owning a fraction of the aircraft. 

Once the plane becomes operational, revenues generated from:

- Passenger ticket sales  
- Cargo and freight shipments  
- Optional services (onboard purchases, priority boarding, etc.)

are used to **cover operational costs**, and the **net profit is distributed** to investors based on the number of seats owned. The operating company retains **20% of the net profit** as a service and management fee.
